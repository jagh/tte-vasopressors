        "**Background and rationale**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Vasopressor use in severely injured trauma patients has been discouraged due to concerns that vasoconstriction will worsen organ perfusion and result in increased mortality and organ failure in hypotensive trauma patients.\n",
        "- Early observational data showed higher odds of death among patients receiving vasopressors. SR 2017 - unadjusted RR from 2.31 to 7.39, but unable to provide conclusions due to high risk of bias: patients who received vasopressors were systematically sicker than patients treated without vasopressors. One clinical trial (n=78) was too imprecise to yield meaningful results. (BMJ)\n",
        "- A large nationwide cohort study in Japan in 2018 including 3,551 patients found that vasopressor use was independently associated with increased in-hospital mortality after adjustment for confounders (OR 2.168; 95% C, 1.442-3.320),using a propensity score-matched cohort.\n",
        "- Recent  pathophysiology findings show that initial vasoconstriction evolves into a second sympathoinhibitory phase marked by diminished catecholamine effect and depletion of neurohormonal stores. The loss of vasomotor tone results in progressive hypotension and impaired perfusion, a state in which arterial pressure may not be restored even after blood volume replacement.\n",
        "- Current European guidelines recommend the use of vasopressors when restrictive fluid therapy fails to achieve a target arterial pressure of SBP ≥80 mmHg to maintain tissue perfusion.\n",
